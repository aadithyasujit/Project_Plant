# Project_Plant

Project Plant is an attempt to automate a Garden monitoring system. New to IoT, curious to see how far can this attempt go. With a vision 
to completely monitor and control environmental conditions to trigger seed germination and assist sapling growth until the plant is ready 
to join the main garden. 

I have decided try my hands on a very basic garden monitering and feedback system. But have included stages for as far and fancy as I could envision.    

  Stage 1
  - Learn about sensors and read out values of the plant environment.
  - Process and send out data to web/app based program for remote monitoring. 
  - Build a informative GUI and may be add some plant status alerts or notification.
  
  Stage 2
  - Develop a response system that can take action to the alerts (water,light,moisture,temperature)
  - Close the feedback system based on given conditions*. 
  - Record initial input conditions at the time of seeding. Act and maintain accordingly untill plant ready phase. 
  - Develop database of several seed germination and sapling growth.
  
  Stage FaNcY !  
  - Monitor and control acidity and properties of soil !!   ## What ?? is that even a parameter to control?? -- need research ! 
  - Come up with a fancy casing/ design for this "Plant_Incubator".
  
  Stage OMG !
  - Improvise Computer Vision for monitoring and control. 
  - Scale up !! An xy axis hand for seeding multiple rows, watering !
